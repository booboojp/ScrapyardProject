He will always be my pookie,
Morgan Freenman.
I will love you to the grave.

Have you ever thought to yourself? *"Where are da ops? Why is no one **motivating** me to get off my ass and stop doing weird shit online?"* Or do you feel depressed and want a laugh? Well, I have the solution for you! 👇

## 🎭 Introducing.... **"I don't know" Said my Teammate** (made in Scrapyard NoVa!) 🎭

This revolutionary FOSS (Free Open Source Software) will analyze what you are doing randomly, and then give you the feedback that your father never held back, cruelly.

> But this time we realized that people might not like that, because social norms this, abuse laws that... yap yap yap so boring! So we held back a little.... just a little. 😈

## 🏆 Hackathon Origin Story 🏆

This digital abomination was birthed during a hackathon where sleep deprivation met energy drinks and coding standards went out the window. The premise was simple: 

> *"What if we combined AI, screenshots, and emotional damage into one package?"* 💭

The answer is this unholy creation that somehow works despite the caffeine tremors that wrote it. We used:

- 👁️ OpenAI's Vision API (to judge your screen content)
- 🎮 PyGame (for that sweet Morgan Freeman popup 💖 💖 💖)
- 🔊 Text-to-Speech (because reading insults isn't painful enough)
- 🙏 Prayer (to keep this mess running)
