```Roses are red,
His hair may be gray,
He will always be my pookie,
Morgan Freenman.
I will love you to the grave.
```

Have you ever thought to yourself? *"Where are da ops? Why is no one **motivating** me to get off my ass and stop doing weird shit online?"* Or do you feel depressed and want a laugh? Well, I have the solution for you! 👇

## 🎭 Introducing.... **"I don't know" Said my Teammate** (made in Scrapyard NoVa!) 🎭

This revolutionary FOSS (Free Open Source Software) will analyze what you are doing randomly, and then give you the feedback that your father never held back, cruelly.

## FOR THE DEMO CHECK PODIUM

> But this time we realized that people might not like that, because social norms this, abuse laws that... yap yap yap so boring! So we held back a little.... just a little. 😈

2. **Judges You Harshly** 🧐 - Sends your screen to AI for detailed analysis
3. **Roasts You Mercilessly** 🔥 - Generates savage commentary about your life choices
4. **Gets in Your Face** 👴 - Summons Morgan Freeman to deliver the roast vocally while appearing on your screen

### 🔑 Setting Up Your API Key (REQUIRED) 🔑

The app needs an OpenAI API key to analyze your screen and generate those devastating insults. Here's how to set it up:

1. **Get an API Key** 💰
   - Go to [OpenAI's website](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - Sign up or log in
   - Create a new API key
   - Prepare for OpenAI to drain your wallet with their pricing

2. **Set Up Your Environment File** 📝
   - Find or create a `.env` file in the project directory
   - Add the following line, replacing `your_api_key_here` with your actual API key:
```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_api_key_here_without_quotes
```

## 🚀 How To Use (Instructions for the Mentally Unstable) 🚀

> **Pro Tip:** For maximum psychological damage, use while attending virtual meetings!

## 🏆 Hackathon Origin Story 🏆

This digital abomination was birthed during a hackathon where sleep deprivation met energy drinks and coding standards went out the window. The premise was simple: 

> *"What if we combined AI, screenshots, and emotional damage into one package?"* 💭

The answer is this unholy creation that somehow works despite the caffeine tremors that wrote it. We used:

- 👁️ OpenAI's Vision API (to judge your screen content)
- 🎮 PyGame (for that sweet Morgan Freeman popup 💖 💖 💖)
- 🔊 Text-to-Speech (because reading insults isn't painful enough)
- 🙏 Prayer (to keep this mess running)

## ⚠️ Privacy Notice ⚠️

This app sends screenshots to OpenAI. If you're doing something illegal/embarrassing, maybe don't use this? We're not responsible for your psychological damage or criminal investigations. Or your parents finding out what you where searching with that **quick** pauce, alt tab but not mute... yikes!

## 📜 License 📜

Free as in *"freedom to regret installing this"* ✨

*Created by someone who clearly needs more hobbies and possibly therapy, or just touch starved* 💔
